# Transportation Cost Analysis â€“ GitHub Portfolio Project

This project showcases a supply chain transportation cost analysis dashboard built in Power BI. It includes:
- Raw Excel data with realistic quality issues
- Data cleaning and transformation using Power Query
- Robust DAX measures for benchmarking and optimization
- An executive dashboard layout for carrier and route analysis

## ðŸ”— Data Model â€“ Table Joins and Relationships

We created the following relationships to connect tables:

- `Shipments_raw[Route]` â†’ `RouteTargets_raw[Route]`
- `Shipments_raw[Carrier]` â†’ `CarrierRates_raw[Carrier]`

These relationships allow us to benchmark route-level performance, calculate potential savings, and filter across dimensions.

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Inspiration

This dashboardâ€™s layout and storytelling approach were inspired by the [How to Power BI YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@HowtoPowerBI), which promotes clean, interactive, and insight-driven visual design.
